    Added timeout detection
    
     - added a timeout value to the select() call: this detects cases where the
       server and peuchre have gotten out of sync, and prevents peuchre from
       hanging; if there has been no activity from the server for 30 seconds,
       peuchre will terminate the game and start another
     - added an option, --notimeout, to allow this timeout to be overridden:
       you'd need this to play a manual client along with peuchre, since the
       human player may not respond inside the 30s window

    Added a timeout to the select
    
     - I saw a case where a player died unexpectedly and the game hung up: if
       30s passes with no activity in the game, select() will timeout, and the
       game will be terminated

    Logging changes
    
     - we now log self.id rather than self.name before each log message

Author: Denis McLaughlin <mclaughlin.denis@gmail.com>
Date:   Fri Jul 22 13:33:58 2016 -0600

    Changes related to game counts and logging
    
     - added **kwargs to playGame(), and we pass in gcount from the mainline,
       and playGame() will in turn pass it on to the players; this lets the
       player objects track the game count, even though they are instantiated
       new for each game
     - changed player names from "p0", "p1", etc, to "p0t1", "p1t2", to make it
       easier to determine who is on which team
     - removed log level info from the file logging, since it wasn't useful
     - removed DEBUG logs from file logging
     - made it so the final stats print doesn't clear the screen, since it was
       clearing all xterm history

    Changes relating to logging
    
     - we track trick deltas now, and report them in the log at the end of
       each trick
     - previously each log message was preceded by the client name; I changed
       this to a combined name + game/hand/trick count, to make it easier to
       track log messages related to each game
     - there's a setId() which will set the id string, all instances of
       info(self.name+ have been changed to info(self.id+
     - removed some other messages to tidy log output

    Return the remapped hand string from addChand()
    
     - by returning the remapped calling hand, it will be stored in the
       peuchre.log file, which will allow us to track the details of any
       hand; I think this is needed because in initial runs, I was seeing
       euchres on some surprisingly powerful hands, so I want to be able to
       confirm the behaviour

    Added tracking of the remapped calling hand
    
     - by capturing the remapped calling hand, it will be stored in the
       peuchre.log file, which will allow us to track the details of any
       hand; I think this is needed because in initial runs, I was seeing
       euchres on some surprisingly powerful hands, so I want to be able to

    Minor change to keyboard handler

commit 8da612d0119a170d27fbde26b0eb88f5f32dcbc6
Author: Denis McLaughlin <mclaughlin.denis@gmail.com>
Date:   Fri Jul 22 01:39:21 2016 -0600

    Lots of changes related to stats gathering
    
     - added creation of Record object, and passing it to the Players as we
       create them, so they can record information
     - moved the game play logic from the mainline into a playGame() function:
       this lets us call it repeatedly, which is key to having the peuchre
       script capable of playing more than one game in a row, which we need to
       track stat information
     - because the players information is now local to playGame(), the
       allJoined() and sendStart() routines now take the players list as an
       argument
     - the playGame() uses the return value of parseMessage() to determine if
       the player is still valid: if parseMessage() returns false, the player
       isn't valid, and is removed from the players list; as players receive
       the GAMEOVER message, they return false, and are removed, and once all
       are removed, the while loop in playGame exits and returns control to the
       mainline, which then triggers another game
     - added options to specify the server and port, and to specify whether
       the live stats view should be enabled; if the stats view is enabled,
       then quiet is automatically enabled
     - added an option to specify the number of games to loop for
     - changed the option names that specify the team classes, to synch with the
       change from 0-1 to 1-2
     - add a keyboard exception handler, to catch ^C and do a final print() and
       writeForce() on the Record object

Author: Denis McLaughlin <mclaughlin.denis@gmail.com>
Date:   Fri Jul 22 01:28:06 2016 -0600

    Lots of changes, mostly around record keeping
    
     - the __init__() method supports receiving a record object (via kwargs),
       which will be used to record various stats during hand play
     - fixed major bug with parsing tricks and score results from STATE messages:
       I had thought the range was 0-1, but it was actually 1-2, bleh, stupid
       Denis
     - object now monitors score changes, so we can report score deltas to the
       record object
     - store the original hand information in self.originalhand, so we can report
       the full hand at the end of the hand (self.hand is modified as we play)
     - at end of each hand, the maker logs the hand they made, the trump, and
       the score delta, for tracking in the Record object
     - when each player follows, they log the number of cards in their hand and
       the number of playable cards, for tracking in the Record object
     - made return values of various sub-parseMessage() calls more consistent:
       now a True return from parseMessage() means normal and False means the
       client is borked and should be killed; this was generally true before,
       but now that the mainline expects a false to indicate game end, I made the
       handling of this more consistent
     - changed some messages that were logged from player 0 to be logged from the
       maker; doesn't priviledge player 0, and is more useful for debugging, since
       the maker's view is key (some places still use player 0, if it's before the
       maker is determined)
     - tweaked all return calls to use spaces rather than parens
     - miscellaneous minor comment fixes

    New object used to track stats from each of the players
    
     - it tracks game related data, calling hand data, and follow data
     - writes relevant data to a file every 60 seconds
     - can print live information to the screen

    Some changes to support the coming record object
    
     - added a misc/ dir with a couple of utility scripts in them: nothing
       really useful, just handy to have around
     - some changes to card.py: it allows use of T or 10 as the value of the
       10 card, and adds a routine to map from suit index to name

    Some white space tidying

commit a3960d28e0e1aa3a36434ab62b60003ba860d429
Author: Denis McLaughlin <mclaughlin.denis@gmail.com>
Date:   Sat Jul 16 01:35:47 2016 -0600

    Changes to support user specification of classes for team 0 and team 1
    
     - added a new file, randomplayer.py: it implements Player, which is
       a working example of the sub-class euchre player
     - renamed euchreclient.py to euchreplayer.py, to keep the terminology
       consistent
     - renamed the class inside euchreplayer.py from EuchreClient to
       EuchrePlayerb, to keep the terminology consistent
     - moved the actual decision making of the sendOrderPass(), sendDrop(),
       sendDefend(), sendPlayLead(), and sendPlayFollow() methods in EuchrePlayer
       to method that are called decideOrderPass(), decideDrop(), decideDefend(),
       decidePlayLead(), and decidePlayFollow() respectively: these methods are
       expected to be implemented in the real player class, which in this case
       is found in the randomplayer.py file
     - all log output from these routines are moved to the sub-class: the parent
       EuchrePlayer class should be as silent as possible to leave the logging
       logic in the real player class
     - in the mainline script, added options for --team0 and --team1: with these,
       we can specify the class name of the classes to be used for team 0 and
       team 1; these options default to randomplayer (the provided player class)
     - we instantiate the named team classes via __import__, and check that they
       implement the required methods via the callable() method

    Changes to play with <4 clients: this lets a manual client play with the automated clients
    
     - the sendJoin() method in the client now directly checks for a JOINACCEPT,
       JOINDENY, or DECLINE message, and returns true or false, to let the
       code calling sendJoin() to determine if it was successful
     - initialize some variables in the client constructor
     - parse out the reason string from the JOINDENY message
     - add the parseDecline() handler
     - promote the state and creator attributes for the client to the client's
       state[] dict
     - make changes in the mainline so we're not dependent on a specific number
       of clients
     - remove some old code

    Woo hoo, a full game can now be played!
    
     - added a printScore() method, split the status() method into gameStatus()
       and playerStatus(), so we can be more selective about what we print
     - various minor logging changes, to reduce chattyness and improve
       readability
     - changed self.hand from a set to a list, since it made it easier to
       selectively remove items from it
     - general rewrite of sendPlayLead(), sendPlayFollow() to accomodate change
       to self.hand type
     - added a removeCard() function, to accomodate changes to self.hand type
     - added handlers for HANDOVER and GAMEOVER messages
     - changes to followCards() method, to fix bugs: the left was being added
       as a valid card for its nominal suit rather than its effective suit
     - added stats output to followCards() to generate stats to see what the
       follow % of different tricks in the hand are: mmmm, dataaaaaa
     - made logging to peuchre.log append, so we can keep data from multiple
       runs

    More changes to support a full game
    
     - added suitName(), valueName(), and nameValue() static methods to the
       Card class, to support mapping back and forth
     - reformatted log output format
     - greatly cut down on logging chatty-ness, to make it easier to parse
       what's going on in the game
     - split sendPlay() into sendPlayLead() and sendPlayFollow(), because
       the logic is very different between the two
     - sendPlayFollow() calls followCards() to generate list of playable
       cards
     - added processing for PLAYOFFER, PLAYDENY, and TRICKOVER messages
     - changed printHand() to take an argument, so that it can be passed
       a set of playable cards (for example) and print them

    changes to support ordering, dropping, and defending
    
     - rename euchred.py to euchre-client.py
     - rename class in euchre-client.py to EuchreClient
     - made order offer self-driving: when a player receives an orderoff for
       itself, it will respond: this means I don't need to drive the order
       from the mainline script
     - implemented a sendDrop() as a response to a drop offer
     - implemented a sendDefend() as a response to a defend offer, but getting
       a DEFENDENY on what should be a valid DEFENDPASS
